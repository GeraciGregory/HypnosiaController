# Description

[Hypnosia](https://www.hypnosia.ch/) is a young startup from the Business eXperience (BeX) program, which was born from the union between
engineers and economists. 
<br>
The project consists of developing and implementing a prototype of a matrix display composed of watch movements (biaxial and tri-axial), from the company SOPROD SA. 
<br>
Combining both the fields of mechatronics, electronics, computer science and mechanics, the project will consist in the development of a Central Controller to control and manage all of the engine movements. The main controller will also allow Bluetooth connection to a smartphone for remote, wireless communication.
